## Project Overview

PX-Prep-for-QB is built for organizations that use POS systems and need to prepare the data for seamless import into QuickBooks. The project includes two main scripts:

1. **`px_prep_bank_data.py`**: Processes bank transaction data, filters Square Inc. transactions, and formats them for QuickBooks import.
2. **`pos_sales_processor.py`**: Processes POS sales data, calculates sales tax, and generates a structured CSV file ready for QuickBooks.

---

## Features

- **Bank Data Processing**: Filters transactions and groups them by day for easier reporting.
- **POS Sales Processing**: Automatically calculates sales tax and organizes sales categories such as admissions, donations, and gift sales.
- **Configurable Output**: Both scripts allow flexible output file and folder naming, either manually specified or automatically generated.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Designed to be run as simple command-line scripts, making it easy to integrate into your workflow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, you need:

- **Conda** (package management system and environment manager)
- **Python 3.x** (installed within a Conda environment)

### Setting up the Conda Environment

To install and run PX-Prep-for-QB, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
2. 
    ````bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PX-Prep-for-QB.git
    cd PX-Prep-for-QB
    ````

2. **Create and activate a Conda environment**:
    You already have a Conda environment `qb` created with Python 3 installed:
    
    ````bash
    conda create --name qb python=3
    ````
    Activate the environment:
    ````bash
    conda activate qb
    ````

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    The project uses `pandas` for data processing. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`:
    
    ````bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ````

## Scripts Overview

### `px_prep_bank_data.py`

#### Purpose:
This script processes bank transaction data, specifically filtering transactions from Square Inc., and outputs them in a format suitable for import into QuickBooks.

#### Key Features:
- Filters transactions where `Credit` is not null and the description starts with `Square Inc`.
- Saves each dayâ€™s transactions in a separate CSV file.
- Flexible output folder specification, either manually set or auto-generated.

---

### `pos_sales_processor.py`

#### Purpose:
This script processes POS sales data, calculates the appropriate sales tax, and outputs formatted sales data into a CSV file ready for QuickBooks import.

#### Key Features:
- Handles different categories like admissions, gift sales, donations, and sales tax.
- Automatically calculates and processes sales tax for each category.
- Option to specify output file, or the script will generate a default output file.

---

## Usage

Once the environment is set up and the required dependencies are installed, you can run the scripts using the following instructions:

### Running `px_prep_bank_data.py`

#### Command-Line Usage:

````bash
python px_prep_bank_data.py <input_file> [-o <output_folder>] [-t <template_file>]
````

#### Parameters:

- `<input_file>`: The path to the CSV file containing bank transaction data.
- `-o`, `--output`: (Optional) The output folder where the processed CSV files will be saved. If not provided, the script will create a folder with the name of the input file and append `_output`.
- `-t`, `--template`: (Optional) The path to the template CSV file that defines the output structure. Defaults to `table_template.csv` in the working directory.

#### Example:

````bash
python px_prep_bank_data.py transactions.csv -o ./output_folder -t ./template_file.csv
````

This will process the `transactions.csv` file, save the output in `output_folder`, and use `template_file.csv` to structure the output.

---

### Running `pos_sales_processor.py`

#### Command-Line Usage:

````bash
python pos_sales_processor.py <input_csv> [-o <output_csv>]
````

#### Parameters:

- `<input_csv>`: The path to the CSV file containing sales data.
- `-o`, `--output`: (Optional) The output CSV file to write the processed data. If not provided, it defaults to `<input_file>_output.csv`.

#### Example:

````bash
python pos_sales_processor.py sales_data.csv -o formatted_output.csv
````

This will process the `sales_data.csv` file and save the formatted output to `formatted_output.csv`.

### Additional Notes

- You may need to customize the template CSV file used in `px_prep_bank_data.py` based on the structure required by your QuickBooks import.
- Test the output files with a small dataset before using them with your actual QuickBooks data to ensure the formats are correct.
